# DIFFgraph

DIFFgraph is about ***difference knowledge engineering tools.***  Specifically, it is for **GRAPHICAL COGNITIVE INTELLIGENCE** engineering.

The vision for this DIFFgraph is extremely minimalist ... human-readable, human-edit-able, therefore a STANDARD but ***human-curate-able*** JSON/YAML format... formatted lists which used by other tools that use a JSON or YAML format to present graphs that might be something akin to a [*conventional commits*](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format.


## DIFFversity

DIFFgraph is really about VISUAL tools, but the engineering behind that goes beyond just making automatic semantic connections.  It's a matter of HYBRID intelligence, not just machine intelligence and computational linguistics, but more than that ... it's about humans really listening, arguing, debating and ***understanding*** DIFFERENCES. 

[DIFFversity](https://diffwtf.github.io/) is a fundamentally different learning paradigm, a DIFFERENT approach to thinking and learning ... because [DIFFversity](https://diffwtf.github.io/) is about ***appreciating and savoring differences rather than forcing conformity or forcing agreement.***

The foreseen DIFFgraph discussions would become a sort of a jam on differences and similarities and hybridizations ... beyond simplistic thesis-antithesis-snynthesis algorithms ... ***it's not just about connections -- it's also about really VALUING the differences.***
