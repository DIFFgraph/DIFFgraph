# DIFFgraph

The DIFFgraph is for social knowledge engineering. The vision for DIFFgraph is something like an annotated, discussed graphical hybridization of differenct ideas ... it's sort of what what ConnectedPapers is about ... but perhaps an extension beyond pre-print scientific paper archives to things like Git repositories ... where the DIFFgraph itself is sort of a jam on differences/similarities/hybridizations.
