# DIFFgraph

The DIFFgraph tool itself is for adding social knowledge engineering to other content. 

The vision for this DIFFgraph is minimalist; perhaps restricted to something like Markdown or JSON / CSV formatted lists ... at MOST something like a plug-in. The objective is probably something like GraphQL or a stepping stone to GraphQL, but even less code-intensive ... for more reliable, simpler note-taking that is almost tool-agnositic ... for annotating threads and discussing graphical linkages that are about hybridization of different but similiar, maybe related ideas.

This objective of this tool would be for adding what ConnectedPapers is about to other content. The point is to take discussions into a meta-discussion realm of connections rather than mere factoids ... this realm extends beyond pre-print scientific paper archives to things like Git repositories. 

## DIFFversity

DIFFgraph is really about more than just making connections ... it's about really listening, arguing, debating and ***understanding*** DIFFERENCES. 

[DIFFversity](https://diffwtf.github.io/) is a fundamentally different learning paradigm, a DIFFERENT approach to thinking and learning ... because [DIFFversity](https://diffwtf.github.io/) is about ***appreciating differences rather than forcing conformity.***

The foreseen DIFFgraph discussions would become a sort of a jam on differences/similarities/hybridizations ... ***it's not just about connections -- it's also about differences.***
