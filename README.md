# DIFFgraph

The [***DIFFgraph***](https://diffgraph.github.io/) *tool* or actually a format, which might better be described as something akin to a [*conventional commits*](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format is for social knowledge engineering. 

The vision for [***DIFFgraph***](https://diffgraph.github.io/) STARTS with something like an annotated, discussed graphical hybridization of different ideas, in the manner of what [what ConnectedPapers is about](https://www.connectedpapers.com/about) but it is intended to be a more democratized extension beyond pre-print scientific paper archives to things like Git repositories and beyond... the [***DIFFgraph***](https://diffgraph.github.io/) conversation threads themselves are data, which can be stored in Git repos, or threadrolled copies of jams on differences/similarities/hybridizations.

Thus vision for this DIFFgraph is extremely minimalist ... perhaps restricted to something like Markdown or JSON / CSV formatted lists ... at MOST something, it becomes like a plug-in ... but automating a ***FORMATTED*** list is easy; the difficulty is in the STANDARDIZATION of the format ... ***any moron can automate; EVERY moron feels compelled to do so*** 

The objective of the DIFFgraph format is probably something like GraphQL or what should seen be a stepping stone to GraphQL, but optimized for human-readabilty, ie even less code-dependent ... for more reliable, simpler note-taking that is almost tool-agnositic ... for annotating threads and discussing graphical linkages that are about hybridization of different but similiar, maybe related ideas.

This objective of this format would be for adding tools that bring what ConnectedPapers is about to other content. The point is to take discussions into a meta-discussion realm of subtle differences and not-so-obvious connections rather than mere factoids ... this realm extends beyond pre-print scientific paper archives to things like Git repositories, but it is necessarily opposed to mere fact-checking *which any housecat can do.* 

## DIFFversity

DIFFgraph is really about more than just making connections ... it's about really listening, arguing, debating and ***understanding*** DIFFERENCES. 

[DIFFversity](https://diffwtf.github.io/) is a fundamentally different learning paradigm, a DIFFERENT approach to thinking and learning ... because [DIFFversity](https://diffwtf.github.io/) is about ***appreciating differences rather than forcing conformity.***

The foreseen DIFFgraph discussions would become a sort of a jam on differences/similarities/hybridizations ... ***it's not just about connections -- it's also about differences.***
